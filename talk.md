# Talk

## Intro

1
Hi guys
This will be a Knowledge transfer session
about this recent event I attended at szeged

2
Let's see what the next 10-15 minutes roughly will look like

We will check out
What was the event about first
then
What is Radix and how it's different
then
We will look at their smart contract language called Scrypto
and at the end if anybody has questions I will try to answer them
during a sort Q&A



## What was the event about

3
They talked about how the current financial system is broken
and the role of DeFi and NFTs

### We looked at nfts and whether or not they're expensive jpegs or the future of finance

How they work and why they are useful?
For holding ownership to different rights
Like
Music rights
Game assets
Land rights
They talked about how this market will grow
and

### Platform vision

how their platform can be utilized and why it will be useful
they talked about how fast capital risen
they say 220x'd to $220bn
but
developers are not, they are just 2x'd to 19.000
which means if you do the math
one developer worth is $11.5bn of total value
in terms of the value that they were able to bring on average
to the applications that they're building

I think it's worth to underline this again
because if that's true
it's a huge opportunity for everybody

### Scrypto developer workshop

They showed how the platform works and what is Scrypto
than there was a challenge where a guy showed how to create an escrow smart contract
then there was a part where we in small teams had to reimplement the escrow



## What is Radix?

4
In short it is a Decentralized finance protocol
A public Ledger entirely focused on bringing DeFi into the mainstream

5
And to illustrate that they showed a few guys who marvelled at they solution
like this one

6
from LMFAO

7
who at first glance just invalidated the whole conf
but then I realized that they showed this guy because
he is not a programmer, he is not legit
and if he can still can understand how this works
then it's really accomplishes it's goal to bring DeFi to the mainstream

and after him they also showed a more seasoned guy who also
told nice things about the platform

8
So they really big on pulling in more potential developers

They have a Discord
where you can find useful infos and
people to connect with and collaborate

9
They have some kind of developer program also, that I don't know that much about
but you can check it out on their website
as their Docs

also
they have tons of material about the space, what is what
different concepts
and more importantly resources and examples to how to build them



## Scrypto

10
Scrypto is an asset-oriented programming language for DeFi

You can use it to create smart contracts on the Radix platform
By the way
the platform's native token is called RDX

There are two main concepts if we talk about Scrypto
Blueprints and Components
I felt like thy talk about OOP the whole time
where Blueprints are the classes
and
Components are the objects
But of course if you like to unlock billions and bring in new devs you
can't use already existing terms, you probably have to invent something new

11
So a few things that you can find on their website about Scrypto

It's simple and secure

Powerful, familiar, built for finance
of course if you are familiar with Rust
because it's based on that

Share and get rewarded
this part sounds really cool
they concentrate on open-source
and incentivising sharing code
through what they call a "Blueprint catalog"
so for example if I understand correctly
there is an on network royalty system
which will get developers rewarded
if somebody uses their solution shared in that catalog

so essentially if somebody uses your code you get paid

## Q&A

## Thanks

I created a repo with a few useful links
which you can check out here

I posted this link in the teams group so you can find it there
